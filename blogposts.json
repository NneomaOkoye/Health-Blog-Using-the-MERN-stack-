Gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. Mindful Eating: Pay close attention to the taste, texture, and aroma of your food. Eat slowly and savor each bite. Body Scan: Lie down and mentally scan your body from head to toe, noticing any tension or discomfort. Breathe into those areas to release tension. Mindful Walking: Take a leisurely walk and pay attention to the sensation of each step. Feel the ground beneath your feet and the rhythm of your stride. Gratitude Journal: Write down three things you're grateful for every day. This practice can shift your focus to positive aspects of life.
